Use NumPy *broadcasting* operations to make your code compact and readable.  `kc_model` should return a NumPy array.  The tests will fail if it returns a Python list or any other type of data structure.\n",

This is just for visualization purposes, you should not edit any code in this member funtion.  If `kc_model` is implemented correctly, it should return a plot that looks like\n",
