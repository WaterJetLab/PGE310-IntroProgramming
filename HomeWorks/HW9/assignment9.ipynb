    "# Assignment 9\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Assignment 8](https://github.com/PGE310-Students/assignment8) we used [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) to implement the Kozeny-Carmen (K-C) relationship as a model that relates porosity to permeability through a proportionality constant\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m \\propto \\frac{\\phi^3}{(1 - \\phi)^2} = f(\\phi)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we'll use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to perform similar manipulations within a Dataframe.  We'll also create a simple plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file [poro_perm.csv](poro_perm.csv) contains two columns of data corresponding to porosity and permeablity measurements for a reservoir.  Your first task is to use Pandas to read this file into a Dataframe object and store it as a class attribute called `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second task is to implement `add_kc_model_to_df`.  This member function should use the Kozeny-Carmen relationship above and *create a new Dataframe column* called `'kc model'`.  This new column should be permanently stored in the class attribute `df` that was created in the first task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, use the built in Pandas plot member function for Dataframes to create a *scatter plot* that plots the permeability as a function of `'kc model'`.  You'll notice that the `plot` member function for `KozenyCarmen` has an argument `**kwargs`.  This should be passed as the *last* argument to any Pandas Dataframe plot commands you'll use.  You have to do this for the tests to pass."
