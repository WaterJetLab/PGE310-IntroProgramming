# Assignment 1

The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with git and basic Unix commands.  I've recorded a YouTube video that walks you through this process for the this first assignment.  The assignment submission process is the same for all assignments so you might find it to be a useful reference in the future as well:

It should be obvious, but substitute "PGE310" anywhere you see "PGE383" in the video.

## Instructions

 1. Clone the assignment1 repository to your JupyterLab workspace on <https://spindletop.pge.utexas.edu>.

 2. In the command window, navigate to the assignment1 repository and create a new text file `solution.txt`.

 3. Open the new file `solution.txt` with the text editor and enter the following text **exactly as it appears**: `Hello, World!`.

 4. Commit the new file to the repository and push assignment1 and the changes you made back to [github.com](http://github.com).

 ## Testing

 If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, simply run the command `python test.py` at the command prompt.  A status message of `OK` indicates you have the correct answer.
